## UI Technical Basics

More so than it being individual assignments, the WODs felt like one large activity to me. As such, I will be talking about it not in parts, but as a whole.

Because I am more of a hands on learner rather than the read and process it type, I had some difficulty figuring out the WODs toward the start. I often had to refer to the help video relatively early on, but watching it and learning what each line of code does really helped me to work things out.

Once I got to the third WOD, I felt more comfortable with the code. Though I was still needing the video help, there were things that I could sort of figure out on my own which was a big step up from the beginning. Since, as I mentioned earlier, reading and internalizing information is not my strong suit, I found the WODs to be helpful.

## Preparing for WODs

The latest WOD we completed was invoice1. In this WOD, we practiced utilizing expressions and variables to compute the values for a five item receipt dynamically rather than hard coding them.

I found this WOD to be very doable with only a little bit of assistance from the screencast. The instructions were pretty straightforward, and given what I learned from the hands-on lab experience working with variables and string templates, I had a good idea of what had to be done.

Something that I had struggled with a bit was finding where exactly to place the .toFixed command in the document.write, but after looking at previous labs and trying things out, I was quickly able to piece it together. I also like using the string template because it's kind of fun.

In terms of preparation, I didn't do anything outside of the labs and readings (which is the same as before). I think I may have done some outside research such as searching things on w3schools, but the bulk of preparation was simply what we were provided with on the class site.

To be better prepared, I could review the material more closely. Because I am more of a hands on learner, I often do not take the time I should to properly review readings we are given. If I take it slower and really try to process and memorize the information, it would probably help me a lot more.
