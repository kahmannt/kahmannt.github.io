## UI Technical Basics

More so than it being individual assignments, the WODs felt like one large activity to me. As such, I will be talking about not in parts, but as a whole.

Because I am more of a hands on learner rather than the read and process it type, I had some difficulty figuring out the WODs toward the start. I often had to refer to the help video relatively early on, but watching it and learning what each line of code does really helped me to work things out.

Once I got to the third WOD, I felt more comfortable with the code. Though I was still needing the video help, there were things that I could sort of figure out on my own which was a big step up from the beginning. Since, as I mentioned earlier, reading and internalizing information is not my strong suit, I found the WODs to be helpful.
