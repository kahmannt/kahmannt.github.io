## UI Technical Basics

More so than it being individual assignments, the WODs felt like one large activity to me. As such, I will be talking about it not in parts, but as a whole.

Because I am more of a hands on learner rather than the read and process it type, I had some difficulty figuring out the WODs toward the start. I often had to refer to the help video relatively early on, but watching it and learning what each line of code does really helped me to work things out.

Once I got to the third WOD, I felt more comfortable with the code. Though I was still needing the video help, there were things that I could sort of figure out on my own which was a big step up from the beginning. Since, as I mentioned earlier, reading and internalizing information is not my strong suit, I found the WODs to be helpful.

## Preparing for WODs

The latest WOD we completed was invoice1. In this WOD, we practiced utilizing expressions and variables to compute the values for a five item receipt dynamically rather than hard coding them.

I found this WOD to be very doable with only a little bit of assistance from the screencast. The instructions were pretty straightforward, and given what I learned from the hands-on lab experience working with variables and string templates, I had a good idea of what had to be done.

Something that I had struggled with a bit was finding where exactly to place the .toFixed command in the document.write, but after looking at previous labs and trying things out, I was quickly able to piece it together. I also like using the string template because it's kind of fun.

In terms of preparation, I didn't do anything outside of the labs and readings (which is the same as before). I think I may have done some outside research such as searching things on w3schools, but the bulk of preparation was simply what we were provided with on the class site.

To be better prepared, I could review the material more closely. Because I am more of a hands on learner, I often do not take the time I should to properly review readings we are given. If I take it slower and really try to process and memorize the information, it would probably help me a lot more.

## Progress in Programming

My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:<br>
I started knowing absolutely nothing, so I would say I improved just by having what little coding ability that I do now. I've gained a firmer grasp on the basics we've been taught to the extent that I can think of ways to code something but will need a bit of help actually making it work.

I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:<br>
Thinking more critically and applying what skills I've learned more effectively when trying to problem solve. There were times I turned to chatgpt just for it to spit something out that I should've been able to accomplish on my own. I just hadn't thought to code in that way. I guess that also means being more flexible in my thinking.

I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:<br>
This is mostly true. The last few WODs with no screencast went swimmingly.

The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:<br>
This is mostly true. I don't know about completing labs on my own since that hasn't happened, but I think I could get through it.

I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:<br>
I feel like I've learned a lot from Assignment 1 but I also need a break before jumping right into assignment 2. I don't think I will get that break.

I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:<br>
I was cool with it.

What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):<br>
I think the WODs helped with applying the things from labs. Having the labs to look back on were also very helpful. Having screencasts was nice as well, just to have a crutch when things got confusing.

## Reflecting on Assignment 2
1. Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details<br>
   Assignment 2 was geared toward creating a login page and registration page where users would have to either log in or sign up for an account before getting their invoice. <https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/modules/Assignment2/>
2. What did you learn from this assignment?<br>
   I learned how difficult it is just to have a login and registration page. Without help, I would've had no idea how to write user data to a file with regisration info, pass quantities in the URL so that the invoice actually gets them, etc. It also built upon my coding knowledge, helping me to better understand how to use code to get a specific outcome.
3. Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).<br>
   I did not.<br>
4. How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?<br>
   I did not get help.<br>
5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?<br>
   I think it was easier for me. I had realized from assignment 1 that reviewing the code a bit more closely and thinking critically about it can help me to take chatGPT code and actually get it to work when it flopped.<br>
6. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging<br>
    50% thinking about it, 40% writing, 10% testing<br>
7. Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?<br>
    Using chatGPT both worked well and did not work well. Sometimes it dropped some heat, sometimes it was whack.<br>
8. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?<br>
    Not a single thing.

## Class Reflection
1. Course Goals ITM 352 has the following goals:<br>
1.1 Acquiring basic programming skills in an IT context<br>
Pretty much everything in this class helped me to gain basic programming skills since I had none to start with. Especially as class went on and there was less specific instruction given, it forced me to think for myself which sucked but was also great for growth.<br>

1.2 Understanding why MIS people need basic programming skills and knowledge<br>
Since the premise of MIS is managing the information system, it seems almost synonymous with programming skills/knowledge to me. Maybe I'm wrong there, but I assumed from the start that they were pretty much interconnected.<br>

1.3 Gaining hands-on experience in developing software applications<br>
Damn near everything was hands on, which made it a very useful class. This was definitely the hardest class I've had so far, but it also taught me the most. The assignments especially, due a lot of it being left up to us to figure out, led to a lot of complex problem solving that was truly hands on.<br>

1.4 Experiencing first-hand MIS problems and solutions<br>
Brother I'll tell you there truly was a lot of problem and solution stuff going on. There was always a problem, and eventually a solution that was extremely satisfying to arrive at. However, that solution would open up another problem that had to be solves. The best feeling was finally having everything working as planned after hours and perhaps even days of struggling with issues.<br>

1.5 Experiencing and understanding first-hand project management, working in teams, software development issues<br>
I don't know if what I did counted as project management, nor did I work in a team, but like I said in the last one the issues were phenomenally bad. It was painful spending hours trying to figure something out, but it was equally as rewarding to finally arrive at the holy grail solution.<br>

1.6 Gaining confidence in addressing MIS problems<br>
I'm not sure if this is exactly what the prompt means by gaining confidence, but I do feel that I was more comfortable with the assignments after finishing Assignment 1. It seemed very daunting first going into it because of the sheery chunky mass of the assignment, but I kinda realized that eventually, I would be able to find a solution. I guess what I'm saying is that before, I was worried I wouldn't be able to figure it out, but it got to a point where I was just like damn I can work this down but it's gonna take a long time.<br>

2. Course Elements and Personal Engagement<br>
What did you learn from creating a professional portfolio and using it in ITM 352?<br>
Not much honestly, I feel like I was making an abridged version of my resume, and brother I've been there and done that.<br>

What did you gain from doing the WODs?<br>
The WODs were good practice rounds to prepare me for the Assignments. It wasn't totally all encompassing, but there was a lot that I learned from WODs that helped during the assignments, even if only a little. They were useful.<br>

Were the quizzes helpful in preparing you for the labs?<br>
Not as much as the WODs because I learn better just getting in there and tussling with the beast.<br>

What did you learn from doing the labs?<br>
The labs helped me in the same way as the WODs did, they were pretty similar for me. The labs were a bit more helpful in certain aspects since prof helped us with it and it was a cleaner example of what to do.<br>

What did you learn from doing the essays?<br>
Nothing much I won't lie.<br>

What did you learn from doing Assignment 1 and Assignment 2?<br>
I learned that it's better to first chew on what it is I want to do and how I want to do it. I tried a couple times to give chatGPT the direct prompt and try what it spat out for funsies and it often didn't work. Only after thinking about how I can get something to work and then giving chatGPT that specific isntruction did that thing really start churning out the good stuff.<br>

3. Challenges and Achievements<br>
Detail the specific challenges you encountered during the course, such as understanding new programming concepts, completing WODs, web application development assignments.<br>
The biggest challenge was the increasing ambiguity as the semester went on. Maybe ambiguity isn't the right word for it, but as instructions for assignments came with less guidance in the instructions, instead forcing us to think critically, stuff starting getting harder. It wasn't a good time but it was good for growth.<br>

Explain how you overcame these challenges and the strategies that helped you succeed.<br>
I overcame the challenges by just tussling with the beast brother. I didn't have any strategy or approach; I just worked that chunk of meat down until I finished.<br>

Highlight any particular achievements or milestones in the course that were significant to you.<br>
When doing assignment 1, I had worked on it for quite some time trying to get it right. I had it working 95% as I wanted, but there were still some things I didn't like. I was sick of doing it and I told myself I would just turn it in as is since it's pretty good already. When it came down to it, however, the remaining issues bothered me too much even though they were small. In the last day or two, I put in some extra effort to make it work and I finally succeeded. Better believe I slept good that night.<br>

4. Skill Development and Application<br>
Reflect on the three skill levels outlined in the course (syntactic, algorithmic, application) and discuss your progression through these levels.<br>
They were all one big blur to me honestly. I didn't really split this course into any specific categories or chunks this semester, and it just felt like one slow uphill battle that I eventually got through after a lot of emotional distress.<br>

Describe how the hands-on experience with web-based e-service applications enhanced your understanding and confidence in handling MIS issues.<br>
Like I said before, I didn't know anything and I had no confidence. Now I have some basic knowledge and skills and the confidence that if I just chew on it and consult chatGPT, it'll turn out.<br>

5. Use of AI (e.g. ChatGPT)<br>
Discuss how use of AI enhanced your learning and productivity. Give specific examples of how you used AI effectively.<br>
ChatGPT showed me things that I didn't think was possible. It was a good reference or starting point a lot of the time. I don't have specific examples, but there were many instances where it spit something out that was whack and didn't work, and by looking it over and seeing where it went wrong, I was able to get it working right as rain.<br>

Discuss how use of AI inhibited your learning or and productivity. Give specific examples of how you used AI ineffectively.<br>
I first thought that chatGPT was god and everything it spit would work, so I just copy and pasted some things to see if it would run. Most of the time it didn't, so I kept beating that dead horse and having it spit out other things instead of thinking about it on my own and seeing why it wouldn't run.<br>

6. Future Implications and Professional Growth
Explore how the skills and knowledge gained from ITM 352 can be applied in your future academic and professional endeavors.<br>
I want to pursue something hopefully involving IT, so everything in this class was pretty helpful since it established my foundation with the basics to prep me for learning more in the next courses.<br>

Discuss the potential impacts these skills will have on your career, especially in terms of understanding and addressing MIS problems.<br>
I mean ideally my career would kinda be built off this since I'm hoping to enter the IT field. Therefore, these skills will not just impact my career, they will be the career.<br>

Reflect on the overall value of the course in your educational journey and future career.<br>
Hardest course of my life but it taught me the most and I am grateful to ITM himself. It was very valuable and I don't have a whole lot else to say outside of that.<br>
