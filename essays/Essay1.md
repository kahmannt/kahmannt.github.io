## UI Technical Basics

More so than it being individual assignments, the WODs felt like one large activity to me. As such, I will be talking about it not in parts, but as a whole.

Because I am more of a hands on learner rather than the read and process it type, I had some difficulty figuring out the WODs toward the start. I often had to refer to the help video relatively early on, but watching it and learning what each line of code does really helped me to work things out.

Once I got to the third WOD, I felt more comfortable with the code. Though I was still needing the video help, there were things that I could sort of figure out on my own which was a big step up from the beginning. Since, as I mentioned earlier, reading and internalizing information is not my strong suit, I found the WODs to be helpful.

## Preparing for WODs

The latest WOD we completed was invoice1. In this WOD, we practiced utilizing expressions and variables to compute the values for a five item receipt dynamically rather than hard coding them.

I found this WOD to be very doable with only a little bit of assistance from the screencast. The instructions were pretty straightforward, and given what I learned from the hands-on lab experience working with variables and string templates, I had a good idea of what had to be done.

Something that I had struggled with a bit was finding where exactly to place the .toFixed command in the document.write, but after looking at previous labs and trying things out, I was quickly able to piece it together. I also like using the string template because it's kind of fun.

In terms of preparation, I didn't do anything outside of the labs and readings (which is the same as before). I think I may have done some outside research such as searching things on w3schools, but the bulk of preparation was simply what we were provided with on the class site.

To be better prepared, I could review the material more closely. Because I am more of a hands on learner, I often do not take the time I should to properly review readings we are given. If I take it slower and really try to process and memorize the information, it would probably help me a lot more.

## Progress in Programming

My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:<br>
I started knowing absolutely nothing, so I would say I improved just by having what little coding ability that I do now. I've gained a firmer grasp on the basics we've been taught to the extent that I can think of ways to code something but will need a bit of help actually making it work.

I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:<br>
Thinking more critically and applying what skills I've learned more effectively when trying to problem solve. There were times I turned to chatgpt just for it to spit something out that I should've been able to accomplish on my own. I just hadn't thought to code in that way. I guess that also means being more flexible in my thinking.

I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:<br>
This is mostly true. The last few WODs with no screencast went swimmingly.

The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:<br>
This is mostly true. I don't know about completing labs on my own since that hasn't happened, but I think I could get through it.

I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:<br>
I feel like I've learned a lot from Assignment 1 but I also need a break before jumping right into assignment 2. I don't think I will get that break.

I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:<br>
I was cool with it.

What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):<br>
I think the WODs helped with applying the things from labs. Having the labs to look back on were also very helpful. Having screencasts was nice as well, just to have a crutch when things got confusing.

## Reflecting on Assignment 2
1. Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details
   Assignment 2 was geared toward creating a login page and registration page where users would have to either log in or sign up for an account before getting their invoice. <https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/modules/Assignment2/>
2. What did you learn from this assignment?
   I learned how difficult it is just to have a login and registration page. Without help, I would've had no idea how to write user data to a file with regisration info, pass quantities in the URL so that the invoice actually gets them, etc. It also built upon my coding knowledge, helping me to better understand how to use code to get a specific outcome.
3. Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).
   I did not.
4. How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?
   I did not get help.
5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?
   I think it was easier for me. I had realized from assignment 1 that reviewing the code a bit more closely and thinking critically about it can help me to take chatGPT code and actually get it to work when it flopped.
6. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
    50% thinking about it, 40% writing, 10% testing
7. Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?
    Using chatGPT both worked well and did not work well. Sometimes it dropped some heat, sometimes it was whack.
8. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?
    Not a single thing.
