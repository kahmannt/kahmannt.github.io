## UI Basics Technical Essay

Because I am not too good with watching/reading material and internalizing the information, I found myself at a loss most of the time regarding what I should do and how I should do it. Because of this, I did end up moving on toward the video explanation rather quickly.

However, I didn't simply copy the code from the video to my VS code. Rather, I watched what the video did and tried to understand what the code being inputted was and why it was used. I also tried thinking of other ways to get the same result, and I was actually able to find some shortcuts here and there.

I don't really have anything specific to say about the individual WODs, but as a whole I think it really helped me to build a general understanding of html formatting and style sheets. In the future, I hope I can figure out which code tags, commands, etc. to use without needing any references.
